An E commerce platform made using React JS, Redux, Firebase, Firestore.

The application is composed of the following Features:

### Front-End
* A landing page with minimalistic design, with a categories menu and a simple cart with a counter.
* A page with a cart component which opens up and displays the items selected in a summary, also has a checkout button.
* Some of the fields were made using reusable components.
* The cart component also allows to edit the contents of the items selected.
* It's conected to firebase, so addresses each one of the purchases made on the website on there. 
* And when you finally made the purchase it give you an alfanumber code related to the order.


### Firebase
